# Performance Monitoring Report

## Objective
Monitor and optimize query performance using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.

---

## Optimized Queries

### 1. Booking by Date

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM Booking
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';

    Issue: Full scan on large table.
    Fix: Applied RANGE partitioning on start_date.
    Result: Faster execution, only relevant partition scanned.

2. Property by Host

SELECT * FROM Property WHERE host_id = 'uuid';

    Fix: Added index on host_id.
    Result: Switched to index scan, faster lookup.

3. User by Email

SELECT * FROM "User" WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

    Fix: Index on email already exists.
    Result: Fast index-based search.

Query 	Fix 	Result
Booking by date 	Partitioning 	Fast
Property by host 	Index 	Faster
User by email 	Already indexed 	Fast

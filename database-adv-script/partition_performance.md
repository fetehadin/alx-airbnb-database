Partitioning Performance Report

Objective

Partition the Booking table by start_date to improve query performance on large datasets.
Implementation

    The Booking table was partitioned by range on start_date into yearly partitions for 2023, 2024, and 2025.
    Foreign keys and indexes were added to each partition individually.
    Inserts automatically route to the appropriate partition based on start_date.

Performance Test

    A test query fetching bookings for the year 2024 was executed with EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
    Query execution time showed a significant reduction compared to querying the non-partitioned table, due to partition pruning.
    Only the relevant partition (Booking_2024) was scanned, reducing the data scanned and improving speed.

Observations

    Partitioning by start_date is effective for time-based queries common in booking systems.
    Maintenance tasks (e.g., archiving old data) become easier by detaching or dropping old partitions.
    Overall, partitioning enhanced query efficiency and scalability.
